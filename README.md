A Classification Problem

A bank has started to suffer huge loss as its clients are leaving. The banks want to analyze its client data and ascertain the possible reasons for this loss. As there are lot of clients and the bank doesn't know which client's data to study.

To give a proper dataset for data analytics, we have to generate a probabilistic report on the current clients using Artificial Neural Network on the basis of chance of their leaving. Assuming threshold to be 50%, we also have to give a boolean value.
